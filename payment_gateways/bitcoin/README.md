Bitcoin PHP payment library using the bitpay.com service.


Installation
------------
Copy these files into your custom shopping cart implementation directory.


Configuration
-------------
NOTE: PHP 5.x, curl, and SSL is required for use of this BitPay PHP code library.

1. Create an API key at bitpay.com by clicking My Account > API Access Keys > Add New API Key.
2. In the bp_options.php file, configure the options specific to your implementation.


Usage
-----
1. In your shopping cart code, call bpCreateInvoice() with the appropriate orderID, price,
   posData and options.
2. The library will attempt to POST the new invoice information via curl to the BitPay
   network.  If successful, you will receive an invoice in the return response.  Any errors
   in this process will return an array with a single element: 'error' and the exception msg.
3. You may use the bpLog function manually to log any information you would like to track or
   automatically by setting the useLogging option to true in the bp_options file.  The log file
   could potentially get very large, depending on usage, so monitor closely or only use
   during debugging.
